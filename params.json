Although, IF attracts more attention and being used more frequently than other measures, it has been subjected to criticisms, which overcome the advantages of IF. Critically, extensive use of IF may result in destroying editorial and researchersâ€™ behaviour, which could compromise the quality of scientific articles. Therefore, it is the time of the timeliness and importance of a new invention of journal ranking techniques beyond the journal impact factor.\r\n\r\nNumber of Pages in PDF File: 7\r\n\r\nKeywords: Impact factor (IF), Journal ranking, Criticism, Praise, SCOPUS, Web of science, Self-citation\r\n\r\nJEL Classification: L1, L11, L7, M11, M12, M1, M54, Q1, O1, O3, Q31, Q32, P24, P42, P29, L17\r\nAccepted Paper Series\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload This Paper\r\nDate posted: April 28, 2013  \r\nSuggested Citation\r\n\r\nFooladi, Masood, Salehi, Hadi, Yunus, Melor Md, Farhadi, Maryam, Aghaei Chadegani, Arezoo, Farhadi, Hadi and Ale Ebrahim, Nader, Does Criticisms Overcome the Praises of Journal Impact Factor?
